# FSM-Tools

Welcome to the project! Below you will find images that illustrate various aspects of our work.



Here are short descriptions for each of the screenshots you uploaded:

### 1. FSM Tools Main Menu

![Main Interface](https://i.ibb.co/GtLg6dk/image1.jpg)


Description: This is the main menu of the FSM Tools application. It provides four primary options: "Generate Mutants", "FSM Tester and Mutant Killer", "FSMs Synchronizing Sequence Finder", and "FSMs Generator". Each button directs the user to a specific tool within the application.

### 2. FSM Tester and Mutant Killer

![FSM Tester and Mutant Killer](https://i.ibb.co/80dz3Gz/image3.jpg)

Description: This interface allows users to load an original FSM and corresponding mutants to start the testing process. Users can load FSM files, start testing, and view the output. Additional options include clearing the system, exporting the output to a file, and navigating back to the main menu.

---

### 3. Mutant's Generator

![Mutant's Generator](https://i.ibb.co/x35bMQh/image2.jpg)

Description: This screen is used to generate mutants for a given FSM file. Users can upload an FSM file, specify the number of mutants, choose fault types, set the state to be mimicked, define the max execution time, and specify the number of faults per mutant. There are buttons to generate mutants and navigate back to the main menu.

---

### 4. FSMs Generator

![FSMs Generator](https://i.ibb.co/X57dC2Y/image5.jpg)

Description: This tool generates FSMs based on user-defined parameters. Users can specify the number of FSMs, states, inputs, and outputs. Options to ensure the FSMs are initially connected or complete are available. The interface includes buttons to generate FSMs, export to a file, clear the output, and navigate back to the main menu.

---

### 5. FSMs Synchronizing Sequence Finder

![FSMs Synchronizing Sequence Finder](https://i.ibb.co/BZnLjqs/image4.jpg)

Description: This screen allows users to upload an FSM file to find its synchronizing sequence. The interface includes an upload button, a display area for the output, and buttons to clear the system, export the output to a file, and navigate back to the main menu.

These descriptions provide a brief overview of each screen's purpose and functionality within the FSM Tools application.
